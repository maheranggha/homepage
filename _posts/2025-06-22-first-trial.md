### Hello, friends! 👋

Welcome to my personal academic blog! 🎓  
I’ve created this space to share thoughts, experiences, and reflection from my PhD life journey and beyond.

To be honest, I always like to write and share it on the blog I had rather than on Social Media apps. But, it's always challenging to maintain my previous blogs, both on the content and technical parts. Despite so, I never get bored to try again as I have a dream to be a writer. Writer should be writing, right?!

For, now I'm thinking this blog will feature a mix of:
- PhD life journey logs
- Tools I use for learning and productivity
- Updates on my ongoing projects
- Notes from seminars and conferences
- Notes from journal articles I read
- Self-development and reflections
- To be decided

I hope this becomes a meaningful record of the ups and downs of doing a PhD, and maybe even a helpful resource for others walking a similar path.
I might be writing in English or Bahasa depend on my mood 😁

Stay tuned!
