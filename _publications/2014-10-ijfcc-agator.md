This research aims to design and make AGATOR (Automatic Garbage Collector), a rotor robot model as automatic garbage collector to counter accumulation of garbage in the river which has no flow effectively and efficiently. The method of implementation is design and construction. This method includes the identification of needs, analysis of the components required specifically, hardware and software engineering, developing, and testing. The test results obtain data by specification of AGATOR includes IC ATMega16 with 5 Volt voltage and 1,1 mAmpere current, IC Driver with 12 Volt voltage and 1,2 Ampere current, and Limit switch as the controller. Support devices of the robot are mechanical robot, robot control system, sensor system, and actuator robot. The maximum load drives the garbage receptacle until 5 kg. The average speed of robot when take out the garbage is 0,26 m/s.
